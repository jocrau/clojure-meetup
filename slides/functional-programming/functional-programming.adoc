Paradigms and Real-World Use

== !

Functional Programming doesn't prevent you +
from shooting yourself in the foot.

[fragment]#It just provides you with a more sophisticated gun.#

== !

Functional Programming +
is a mindset +
[fragment]#not a set of languages.#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Some languages are "pure" functional programming languages, some make it almost impossible to work with functions. Most languages are somewhat inbetween.
--

== JavaScript

[source,js]
--
    $add3 = function($number) { return $number + 3; };
    $twice = function($fun, $number) { return $fun($fun($number)); }
    $twice($add3, 5);
--

== Clojure

[source,clojure]
--
    (defn add3 [number] (+ number 3))
    (defn twice [fun number] (fun (fun number)))
    (twice add3 5)
--

== Programming Paradigms

[cols="2*.<"]
|===
a|- Non-structured
 - Structured
   * Block-Oriented
   * Object-Oriented

a|- Imperative
- Declarative
  * Functional
  * Logical
2+a|- Reactive, Event-Driven, Generic, ...
|===

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Imperative (explicit control flow: "first do this and then do that")
- Declarative (describe the logic without making the control flow explicit)
--


== Functional Paradigm

- Pure functions
- Higher-order functions
- Lazy evaluation
- Immutable state
