== Function Composition

Functions can be nested or composed.

[source]
----
(count (str (inc 9)))
----

This expression is evaluated from inside out:

- `9` evaluates to itself.
- `(inc 9)` evaluates to `10`.
- `(str 10)` evaluates to `"10"`.
- `(count "10"`) finally evaluates to 2 (as it counts the number of characters in the string).

The functions `count`, `str`, `inc` can be composed into one single function that can be applied to any argument:

[source]
----
(def composed-fun (fn [value] (count (str (inc value)))))

(composed-fun 9)
----

Or with the Clojure `comp` function:

[source]
----
(def composed-fun (comp count str inc))

(composed-fun 9)
----

`composed-fun` is the functional composition of the three functions. The functions are applied from right to left (first `inc` then `str` then `count`).
