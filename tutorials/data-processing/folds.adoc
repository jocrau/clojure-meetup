== Map, Reduce, Folds

The process called "mapping" applies a given function to each element of a sequence of values producing a sequence of values of the same length. Let's take a look at the Clojure function `map`:

[source]
----
(map inc [1 2 3])
----

The function `inc` is applied to 1, 2, and 3. Any function that takes one argument can be mapped over the sequence:

[source]
----
(map str [1 2 3])
----

And we can use any collection of values that can be turned into a sequence, like a list

[source.do-not-eval]
----
(map inc '(1 2 3))
----

or a set

[source]
----
(map inc #{1 2 3})
----
