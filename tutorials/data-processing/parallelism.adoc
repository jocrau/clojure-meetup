== Concurrency and Parallelism

Parallelism and Concurrency describe different concerns.footnoteref:[,Definitely take a look at https://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide and https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/parallelism-is-not-concurrency/ for more background, or even http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf for a very detailed mathematical introduction.]

Concurrency::
    How to *structure* a computation into independent processes and coordinate between them.

Parallelism::
    How to *execute* (dependent or independent) processes at the same time.

To execute code in parallel, it needs to be concurrent. But that also is true for sequential execution (eg. using the CPU clock for coordination).

== Distributed Systems

"A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable.footnoteref:[,See https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/distribution/]"
