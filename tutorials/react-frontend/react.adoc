== React

React provides an abstraction over the DOM (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model[Document Object Model]) called the Virtual DOM. Rather than manipulating the DOM directly it provides a data-driven API to update the state of user interface.

React renders elements into an existing DOM container. The elements can be expressed in HTML-style code. In this case the container is referenced by `klipse_container` (which is a `div` element below the code snippet).

[source,jsx]
----
ReactDOM.render(
  <p className="greeting">Hello, world!</p>,
  klipse_container
);
----

The element `<p className="greeting">Hello, world!</p>` is written in JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is transpiled into JavaScript `React.createElement()` on the fly.

[source,transpile-jsx]
----
<p className="greeting">Hello, world!</p>
----

An element is a lightweight description of how the actual DOM instance should look like. It is just a regular JS object and not the DOM instance itself.

[source,js]
----
React.createElement(
  "p",
  {className: "greeting"},
  "Hello, world!"
);
----
