== Recursion

Straight forward calculation of the factorial of 8 (or in mathematical notation 8!):

  (* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)

The same as function `factorial` calling itself (recursive function call, or short recursion). What is the reason for the second argument `acc`? Can we get rid of it?

[source]
----
  (defn factorial [n acc]
    (if (zero? n)
      acc
      (factorial (dec n) (* n acc))))

  (factorial 8 1)

Clojure provides the form `recur` to make sure we recur from the "tail".

[source]
----
  (defn factorial [n acc]
    (if (zero? n)
      acc
      (recur (dec n) (* n acc))))

  (factorial 8 1)

[source]

  (defn factorial [n]
    (loop [cnt n
           acc 1]
      (if (zero? cnt)
        acc
        (recur (dec cnt)
               (* cnt acc)))))

  (factorial 8)

  (defn factorial [n]
    (reduce * (range 1 (inc n))))

  (factorial 8)
