Note that the field names __meta\n  and __extmap are currently reserved and should not be used when\n  defining your own records.\n\n  Given (defrecord TypeName ...), two factory functions will be\n  defined: ->TypeName, taking positional parameters for the fields,\n  and map->TypeName, taking a map of keywords to field values."],"^4T",["^ ","^5G",null,"^5H",["^ ","^5I","/Users/jocrau/dev/workspaces/clojure-meetup/resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5J",2466,"^5K",16,"^5L",2466,"^5M",26,"^5O",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["~$size"],["^6N","^?1"],["^6N","^?1","~$&","~$more-sizes"]]]]],"^5T",["^ ","^5U",true,"^5V",4,"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"]]],"^5P",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1","~$&","^?2"]]],"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null,null]]]],"^55","~$cljs.core$macros/make-array","^5U",true,"^5I","resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5M",26,"^5T",["^ ","^5U",true,"^5V",4,"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"]]],"^5P",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1","~$&","^?2"]]],"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null,null]]],"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"]]],"^60",null,"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null,null]],"^5K",1,"^5J",2466,"^5O",true,"^5L",2466,"^5V",4,"^61",false,"^5P",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1"],["^5X","^5Y","^6N","^?1","~$&","^?2"]]]],"^4U",["^ ","^5G",null,"^5H",["^ ","^5I","/Users/jocrau/dev/workspaces/clojure-meetup/resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5J",1073,"^5K",31,"^5L",1073,"^5M",51,"^5N",true,"^5O",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["~$x"]]]]]],"^55","~$cljs.core$macros/unchecked-negate-int","^5U",false,"^5I","resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5M",51,"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","~$x"]]],"^60",null,"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null]],"^5K",1,"^5J",1073,"^5O",true,"^5L",1073,"^5V",3,"^61",false,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["~$x"]]]]],"^5N",true],"~$simple-test-expr?",["^ ","^5G",null,"^5H",["^ ","^5I","/Users/jocrau/dev/workspaces/clojure-meetup/resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5J",835,"^5K",13,"^5L",835,"^5M",30,"^6A",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["^5@","~$ast"]]]]]],"^6A",true,"^55","~$cljs.core$macros/simple-test-expr?","^5U",false,"^5I","resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5M",30,"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5@","^?6"]]],"^60",null,"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null]],"^5K",1,"^5J",835,"^5L",835,"^5V",2,"^61",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["^5@","^?6"]]]]]],"^4V",["^ ","^5G",null,"^5H",["^ ","^5I","/Users/jocrau/dev/workspaces/clojure-meetup/resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5J",1058,"^5K",31,"^5L",1058,"^5M",44,"^5N",true,"^5O",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["~$x"]]]]]],"^55","~$cljs.core$macros/unchecked-inc","^5U",false,"^5I","resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5M",44,"^5W",["^5Q",[["^5X","^5Y","~$x"]]],"^60",null,"^5Z",["^5Q",[null,null]],"^5K",1,"^5J",1058,"^5O",true,"^5L",1058,"^5V",3,"^61",false,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[["~$x"]]]]],"^5N",true],"^4W",["^ ","^5G",null,"^5H",["^ ","^5I","/Users/jocrau/dev/workspaces/clojure-meetup/resources/js/klipse/compiled/cljs/core.cljc","^5J",840,"^5K",16,"^5L",840,"^5M",19,"^5O",true,"^5P",["^5Q",["^5R",["^5Q",[[],["~$x"],["~$x","~$&","^;:"]]]]],"^63","Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right.
