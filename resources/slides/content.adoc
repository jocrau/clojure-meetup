Paradigms and Real-World Use

== !

Functional Programming doesn't prevent you +
from shooting yourself in the foot.

[fragment]#It just provides you with a more sophisticated gun.#

== !

Functional Programming +
is a mindset +
[fragment]#not a set of languages.#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Some languages are "pure" functional programming languages, some make it almost impossible to work with functions. Most languages are somewhat inbetween.
--

== !

Functional Programming +
affects the structure of a program +
[fragment]#and how we program.#

== !

> "A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing."

== Programming Paradigms

[%step]
- Non-structured
- Structured
  * Block-Oriented
  * Object-Oriented
- Imperative +
Explicit control flow ("first do this and then do that")
- Declarative +
Describes the result without making the control flow explicit
  * Functional
  * Logical
- Reactive, Event-Driven, Generic, ...

== Functional Paradigm

- Pure functions
- Higher-order functions
- Lazy evaluation
- Immutable state

== Pure Functions

[%step]
- no side-effects
- same arguments evaluate to the same result

== Higher-order Functions

[%step]
- function as value
- a function can be an argument to another function
- a function evaluation can be a function

[source,php]
----
    $add3 = function($number) { return $number + 3; };
    $twice = function($fun, $number) { return $fun($fun($number)); }
    echo($twice($add3, 5));
    // 11
----

[source,clojure]
----
    (def add3 [number] (+ number 3))
    (def twice [fun number] (fun (fun number))
    (twice add3 5)
    ; 11
