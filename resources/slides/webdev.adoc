a|
- Input Validation
- Session Handling
- Web User Experience (UI, client-side development)
- Resource handling, caching
- Formatting and transformation (JSON, CSV, ...)
- etc.
|===

== What to look out for?

[cols="2*<.<"]
|===
a|
- philosophy, architecture, features
- well documented
  * existent
  * complete
  * easy to understand and follow
  * readable code
- well tested
  * expressive, readable tests
- up- and downstream dependencies
  * widely used
  * up-to-date dependencies

a|
- developer network
  * number of collaborators
  * style of collaboration (pull-requests, core team, etc.)
  * backing by company or OSS association
- issue queue, road map
- forums, comparisons, testimonials from colleagues
- license, costs
- don't forget Java and JavaScript libraries
|===

== Web Server

- link:http://www.http-kit.org/[HTTP-Kit]
  * performant and lightweight
  * well documented and simple to use
- link:https://github.com/ztellman/aleph[aleph]
  * very performant and lightweight
- link:http://immutant.org/[Immutant]
  * based on Red Hat JBoss EAP
  * application server ready
  * cohesive set of battle tested Java libraries

== HTTP Request Handling

[cols="3*.<"]
|===
a|
link:https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring]

 - specification for request and response
 - set of small libraries (eg. parsing request params, compressing body)
 - basis for most web applications in Clojure land

a|
link:http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[Liberator]

- modeled after Erlang's Webmachine
- focus on resource definition
- conforms to HTTP specification
- batteries included

a|
link:https://github.com/juxt/yada[Yada]

- new kid on the block
- well documented
- easy to use
- focus on resource definition
- conforms to HTTP specification
|===

== Routing

- link:https://github.com/weavejester/compojure[Compojure]
  * well established and maintained
  * built around HTTP verbs
- link:https://github.com/juxt/bidi[Bidi]
  * simple but powerful
  * well maintained
  * well documented

Good comparison on the link:https://github.com/juxt/bidi#comparison-with-other-routing-libraries[Bidi page]

== Security

- link:https://github.com/cemerick/friend[Friend]
  * opinionated and relatively complex
  * batteries included
- link:https://github.com/funcool/buddy[Buddy]
  * modular and flexible
  * well maintained

== Persistence

[cols="3*.<"]

a|
link:http://www.datomic.com/[Datomic]

- database = immutable value
- time-aware
- granular information model (Datom)
- flexible schema
- database functions
- declarative query language (Datalog)
- queries = data

a|
link:https://adambard.com/blog/clojure-sql-libs-compared/[SQL]

|===

== HTML Templating

[cols="3*.<"]
|===
a|
link:https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup[Hiccup]

  - fast
  - CSS3 selector based
  - difficult to understand
a|
link:https://github.com/fhd/clostache[Clostache]

== Build Your Own Web Stack

Start with your own simple stack

- Clojure/Clojurescript
- Aleph
- Ring
- Yada/Bidi
- Buddy
- Hiccup
- Reagent
- Datomic

then extend or switch to exiting framework
