== What to look out for?

[cols="2*.<"]
|===
a|- features
  - philosophy, architecture
  - well documented
    * existent
    * complete
    * easy to understand and follow
    * readable code
  - well tested
    * expressive, readable tests

a|- up- and downstream dependencies (see: https://crossclj.info/)
    * widely used
    * up-to-date dependencies
  - developer network
    * number of collaborators
    * style of collaboration (pull-requests, core team, etc.)
    * backing by company or OSS association
  - issue queue, road map
  - forums, comparisons, testimonials from colleagues
  - license, costs
  - don't forget Java and JavaScript libraries
|===

== HTTP Request Handling

- link:http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[Liberator]
    * asdfsdf
- link:https://github.com/juxt/yada[Yada]

== Routing

- link:https://github.com/weavejester/compojure[Compojure]
  * well established and maintained
  * built around HTTP verbs
- link:https://github.com/DomKM/silk[silk]
- link:https://github.com/juxt/bidi[bidi]
  * simple but powerful
  * well maintained
  * personal favorite

Good comparison: https://github.com/juxt/bidi#comparison-with-other-routing-libraries

== Security

- link:https://github.com/cemerick/friend[Friend]
  * opinionated and relatively complex
  * batteries included
- link:https://github.com/funcool/buddy[buddy]
  * modular and flexible
  * well maintained

== HTML Templating

- link:https://github.com/cemerick/friend[Friend]
  * opinionated and relatively complex
  * batteries included
- link:https://github.com/funcool/buddy[buddy]
  * modular and flexible
  * well maintained

== Frameworks

- link:http://www.luminusweb.net/[Luminus]
- link:http://hoplon.io/[Hoplon]
- link:http://pedestal.io/[Pedestal]
  * focuses on APIs
- link:http://arachne-framework.org/[Arachne]
  * well known community members behind it
  * early in development

== Build Your Own Web Stack

Recommendation: start with your own simple stack

- Clojure/Clojurescript
- Ring
- Yada/Bidi
- Buddy
- Hiccup
- Reagent

[fragement]#... then extend or switch to exiting framework#
